# TimeLog ASP.NET Core Web Application

This sample demonstrates a .NET Core 2.2 Web app using Razor with code behind files (no MVC). The 
purpose of the app is to allow an individual to make keep track of their activities.  For 
authentication and authorization, the app uses OpenID Connect to sign in users with a work account 
with the configured Azure Active Directory.


## Getting Started
#### Prerequisites:

* Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code
* Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en)
* .NET Core 2.2 or later (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* Azure Subscription with ability to register an application in the Azure Active Directory

##### Azure Active Directory
This app uses the Azure Active Directory for authorization, so in order to run this app you 
will have to provide a Domain, TenantId and ClientId.  There are instructions on how to do 
this using automation or manually in the Microsoft Azure Sample 
at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/1-WebApp-OIDC/1-1-MyOrg  

##### App Secrets:
This project uses "app secrets" so that information such as the connection string are not 
stored in source code.  App secrets are stored in a json file locally, outside of the project.  
Sample json:
```
{
  "AzureAd:Domain": "<your AD domain>",
  "AzureAd:TenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "AzureAd:ClientId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "ConnectionStrings:TimeLogContext": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=TimeLog_db;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}
```
##### YAML for Azure Pipelines

###### WhiteSource Bolt

##### TypeScript, node.js, jQuery
