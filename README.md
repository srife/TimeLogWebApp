# TimeLog ASP.NET Core Web Application

This sample demonstrates a .NET Core 2.2 Web app that allows an individual to make keep track of their
activities.  For authentication and authorization, the app uses OpenID Connect to sign in users 
with a work account with the configured Azure Active Directory.




## Getting Started
#### Prerequisites:

* Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code
* .NET Core 2.2 or later
* Azure Subscription with ability to register an application in the Azure Active Directory


This app uses the Azure Active Directory for authorization, so in order to run this app you 
will have to provide a Domain, TenantId and ClientId.  There are instructions on how to do 
this using automation or manually in the Microsoft Azure Sample 
at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/1-WebApp-OIDC/1-1-MyOrg
